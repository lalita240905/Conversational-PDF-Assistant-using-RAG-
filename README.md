## **ðŸ“Œ About**  
This project lets you **chat with your PDF documents using AI**. It uses a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** approach, where your document is processed and searched for relevant information to give accurate answers. The system is built with **LangChain** and uses **Google Gemini** as the Large Language Model (LLM) to understand your questions and respond based on the PDF content.

## **âœ¨ Features**  
âœ… **Upload PDFs** â€“ Add one or more PDF files to interact with.  
âœ… **Text Extraction** â€“ Extracts text from uploaded PDFs.  
âœ… **Text Chunking** â€“ Splits large text into smaller chunks for efficient search.  
âœ… **Vector Store** â€“ Uses **FAISS** for fast semantic similarity search.  
âœ… **Conversational AI** â€“ Ask questions, get accurate answers from your documents.

## **âš™ How It Works**  
1. **Upload PDFs** via Streamlit UI.  
2. **Text Extraction & Chunking** for handling large documents.  
3. **Embeddings + FAISS Indexing** for semantic search.  
4. **Query Processing** â€“ User asks a question.  
5. **RAG Pipeline** retrieves relevant chunks and generates answers with Gemini LLM.
